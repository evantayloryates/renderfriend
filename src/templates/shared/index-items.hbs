CompItem:          Represents a composition. You can use properties and methods like numLayers, duration, layers, etc., with a CompItem.
FootageItem:       Represents footage. This can be still images, sequences, audio files, movies, etc. They have properties like file, duration, hasAudio, among others.
FolderItem:        Represents a folder. You can think of this as a container for organizing other items in the Project panel. It has properties like numItems and methods like item(index) to access its children.
AVLayer:           Represents audio or video layers within a composition. This includes text layers, shape layers, cameras, lights, etc. But when you're iterating over items in the Project panel, you won't directly encounter AVLayer objects; you'll interact with them within a CompItem.
CameraLayer:       Represents a camera layer in a composition.
LightLayer:        Represents a light layer in a composition.
ShapeLayer:        Represents a shape layer in a composition.
TextLayer:         Represents a text layer in a composition.
SolidSource:       Represents a solid color source.
MaskPropertyGroup: Represents a mask on a layer.
Effect:            Represents an effect applied to a layer.
